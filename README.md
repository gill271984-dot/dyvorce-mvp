Dyvorce - Ready-to-deploy Next.js + Tailwind project

This project is preconfigured for easy deployment to Vercel.

Quick deploy steps:
1. Unzip dyvorce-full.zip and upload the project folder contents to a new GitHub repo.
2. In Vercel, import the GitHub repository as a new project (Vercel will detect Next.js automatically).
3. Deploy. If using Tailwind, no extra build steps are needed.

If you want, I can also deploy this for you step-by-step.
